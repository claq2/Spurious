        What does the amount of alcohol in a census subdivision mean? Nothing. But it's fun to map it out like it does. (For instance, there might be an LCBO at the border of 2 area that serve both, but the population of the second area won't get counted.)
        <br />
        <br />
        Population and census subdivision data comes from Statistics Canada's 2011 census data, which is the most recent one.

        <br />
        Alcohol inventory comes from <a href="https://lcboapi.com/">LCBO API</a>, which is not actually published by the LCBO, but scraped from its website daily.
        <br />
        <br />
        PostgreSQL and PostGIS provide data storage and the geographic matching of LCBO locations inside subdivisions. PostgreSQL lives in a LinuxMint VM.

        The backend is .NET WebAPI. The front end is <a href="http://aurelia.io">Aurelia</a> written in TypeScript. HTML5 Boilerplate and Bootstrap provide the good looks. It all lives in Azure.
