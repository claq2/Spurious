For each area we need:
- count of beer
- count of wine
- count of spirits

Count of x =
- inventory of a in all stores in area

Get all stores in an area
Get inventories of all stores

Need all inventory in all stores
Need all x inventory in all areas.

Options:
1. Precompute
- weekly/daily get stores and inventory
- compute 3 values for each area
- cache maybe, if PostGres doesn't, which is probably does

2. Realtime
- get all stores and record their locations
- loop through areas to get
	- all stores in that areas
	- inventories for those stores
- stores come in pages
- inventories come in pages?

Hybrid:
1. Preload inventories
2. Figure out for each area the inventory levels
